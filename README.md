The appearance can be customised from `Settings` > `Appearance`

If you are not satisfied with the default options, I have created a modern and user-friendly, custom appearance theme which you can also use.

Download the theme file download from [releases](src/Peace/theme.ini)

The theme file can be imported from `Settings` > `Appearance` > `Read Theme`

> [!NOTE]
> When importing, the `theme.ini` may not appear in the File Explorer preview. This is normal, just select the folder `theme.ini` is in.

### 3. Use Peace



### 4. Use AutoEQ
